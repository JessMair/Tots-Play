# Tots Play - A Milestone Project

My first milestone project, undertaken as part of the Code Institutes Diploma in Software Development.

# Who is this website for?

I have created this website for a small community stay and play centre based in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. 

The site is for parents who are looking to take their baby or toddler out for a couple of hours. 

Th aim of Tots Play is to introduce the potential customer to the facilities available on site and to make the venue appear a welcoming and fun place. 
A place to make connections with other parents and children, and a place to regularly meet.
They can watch their children interact with their environment and grow their skill sets through play and interactions. 

Parents of young children often are stretched for time or multi-tasking. With this is mind, I wanted the page to provide digestible information, at a glance. 
I did not want the site to appear cluttered or present over whelming content. I believe I have achieved this goal. 





# Local testing
At first when I was adding the icons, they were not appearing on the site. I searched as to why this may have been and found that I had not embedded the file link into the index.html file. I placed this at the bottom of the file below the footer. Now that the directory was in the file, the icons appeared without further issue. 
When testing I found the link from contact us page does not lead directly the gallery page. I discovered that this is due to the link for the contact us and gallery page not being embedded in the others respective html file. I added this and it resolved the issue. 

Image in the about section was not loading, although it had initially worked. I changed the image and that led to the image being fixed. 

The images on the gallery page were not loading. I spoke to tutor support who made me aware that the file paths to the files were absolute and not relative as they should have been. I went in and amended this error and straight away the images appeared on the site.
